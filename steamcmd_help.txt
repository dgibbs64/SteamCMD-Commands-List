Use the 'app_update' command to download and update Steam games and
applications on this computer. This is generally intended for game dedicated
server installations, and will only work for games that have been converted
to the new Steam HTTP download system - for games that haven't been
converted yet, you should use the older 'HldsUpdateTool' (Windows) / 'steam'
(linux) command-line tool.

By default, the game is downloaded to the folder
"./SteamApps/common/<gamename>". To change this location, use the
'force_install_dir' command to set the target directory BEFORE running
app_update. Note: Steam will create a directory within the target directory
for storing state information and temporary files; the name of this folder
will be a string of numbers and letters 40 characters long.

You will first need to login to Steam using an account which has access to
the game, or anonymously - type 'help login' for more information.

It's likely you'll want to put all of the necessary calls into a script file
(see "runscript"); here is an example file: 

 @ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1
 @NoPromptForPassword 1
 force_install_dir ../Ricochet/
 login anonymous
 app_update 60 validate
 quit
